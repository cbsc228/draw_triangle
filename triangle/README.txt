BUGS

-rotation does not work correctly

-for some reason the triangle changes shape as it rotates and does not rotate around the origin as expected
possibly something is faulty with the centroid calculation or the casting of variables but I was not able to find
the exact issue

-also, the stop button and reset button are not stopping the animation as expected but the reset button is correctly
clearing the previously inputted data points

-the project is otherwise working and functional
